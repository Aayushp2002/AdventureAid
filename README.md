### Running the Application

In the project directory, you can run several commands:

#### `npm start`

- Launches the app in development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- The page will reload upon file edits.
- Console will show lint errors, if any.

#### `npm test`

- Initiates the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- More info: [Running Tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)

#### `npm run build`

- Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- It correctly bundles React in production mode, optimizing the build for performance.
- The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.
- Your app is ready for deployment!

#### `npm run eject`
